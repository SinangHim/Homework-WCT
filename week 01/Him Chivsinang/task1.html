    <h1>Create a page</h1>
    <h2>Task1</h2>

        Even though modern websites are generally built with user-friendly interfaces, it's useful to
        know some basic HTML. if you know the following17 HTML examp tags(and a few)
        extras), you'll able to create a basic webpage from scratch or tweak the code create by
        an app like Wordpress.
        
        We've provided HTML code example with output fir most of the tag. If you want to see
        them in action, download the sample HTML file at the article.You can play with
        it in text editor and load it up in a browser to see what your change do.
        </pre>
    <h2>1.&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</h2>
    <hr>
    <pre>
        You'll need this tag at the begining of every HTML document you create. It ensures that a 
        browser know that it's reading HTML, and that it expect HTML5,the latest version.
        
        Even though this isn't actually an HTML tag, it's still good one to know.
        </pre>
    <h2>2. &lt;html&gt;</h2>
    <hr>
    <pre>
        This is another tag that tell a browser that it's reading HTML. The &lt;html&gt; tag goes
        straight after the DOCTYPE tag , and you close it with a &lt;html&gt;tag right at the end of your 
        file.Everything else in your document goes between these tags.
        <div style="background-color: gray;">
                  &lt;head&gt;
                      &lt;title&gt;
                          My Website
                      &lt;title&gt;
                  &lt;/head&gt;
        </div>          
        That's the name that will be diplayed as the tab title when it's opened in a browser.
